Ocs-Nagios

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Actually, soap method does not return ip address, the request to integrate it 
in next version of OCSINVENTORY is here http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2791272&group_id=58373&atid=487495

You must apply this patch to get ip address in soap method ( Apache/Ocsinventory/Interface/Inventory.pm)
